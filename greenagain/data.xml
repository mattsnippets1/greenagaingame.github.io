  <description>
    Green Again is a chill and cozy city builder game. Help a tribe of little plant people (the Sproutlings) reclaim their planet taken over by defective robots. Build, decorate, and expand your settlement. Grow crops for your citizens, explore the unknown, and return the land to its former green state!
  </description>

  <history>
    Green Again started as an idea of growing crops on an alien planet. The game design went through several iterations until I settled with the current cozy city builder terraforming game it is now. My goal is to capture the essence of some old classics of settlement and colony builders while focusing on combat-free laid back gameplay that emphasizes restoration and growth.
